Things to do, in no particular order:

 * Fix all the regexp problems that are surely in there
 * Allow for a global config file, and a personal config file
 * Allow some defaults to be set in the config file to shorten command line
 * Tweak PostScript to make sure nothing falls in the "forbidden" MICR area
 * Print receipts or whatever on check blanks that allow space for that
 * Command-line options for payee, date, memo, and amount
   (Print out entire, filled out check, not just empty)
 * Write a GUI around this thing
 * Get more check blank definitions
 * Include a --print option on command line
 * Include a --pdf option on command line
 * Add Document Structuring Convention stuff to the PS file

And finally...
 * Convince someone to have the output professionally tested.
