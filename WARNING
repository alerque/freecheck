MICR printing is a fairly tricky business, at least if you listen to the
people in the industry.  Some tips to make sure this goes well for you:

1) Use magnetic (MICR) toner for the MICR line (NOT for the rest of the check -
   see the --nomicr and --nobody options).  This is the "official" way
   to do it.  At a minimum, use a laser printer.  Bubble jets, ink jets,
   and (need I say it?) dot-matrix printers will not give useable results.

2) Use security check blanks / stock.  This is available various places
   around the web, and it's not terribly expensive.  Do NOT just print
   on plain paper!

3) Make sure your printed MICR line is _exactly_ as shown on your bank-printed
   checks.  If you can't make it the same, let me know what the problem is,
   and I'll see if it's a bug.

And, as mentioned various other places, if your bank charges you a fee
for malformed checks.... you have been warned.   I have sent some checks
though the bank with this and they worked fine, but your mileage may vary.
